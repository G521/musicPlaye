[00:02.96]Ah ah oh oh oh
[00:09.53]Ah ah oh oh oh
[00:13.90]Ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh
[00:17.71]I can hear you but I won't
[00:22.11]Some look for trouble while others don't
[00:26.51]There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
[00:31.85]And ignore your whispers which I wish would go away, oh oh oh
[00:37.39]Ah ah oh oh
[00:40.32]Oh oh
[00:41.81]Ah ah oh oh
[00:45.24]You're not a voice
[00:46.91]You're just a ringing in my ear
[00:49.66]And if I heard you, which I don't
[00:52.28]I'm spoken for I fear
[00:54.62]Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls
[00:59.07]I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls
[01:03.75]I've had my adventure and don't need something new
[01:08.14]I am afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you
[01:12.26]Into the unknown
[01:16.40]Into the unknown
[01:20.71]Into the unknown
[01:27.51]Ah ah oh oh
[01:31.61]Ah ah oh oh oh oh
[01:35.22]What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake
[01:39.77]Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?
[01:46.48]Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?
[01:52.11]Who knows deep down I'm not where I meant to be?
[01:58.86]Every day's a little harder as I feel my power grow
[02:04.00]Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go
[02:09.51]Into the unknown?
[02:14.05]Into the unknown
[02:18.34]Into the unknown
[02:23.24]Ah ah oh oh
[02:24.81]Ah ah oh oh
[02:26.51]Oh oh oh
[02:28.19]Are you out there?
[02:29.50]Do you know me?
[02:30.57]Can you feel me?
[02:31.62]Can you show me?
[02:34.88]Ah ah oh oh
[02:36.89]Ah ah oh oh
[02:39.02]Wah ah oh oh
[02:41.02]Ah ah oh oh
[02:42.43]Oh oh oh oh
[02:44.67]Oh oh oh oh
[02:46.62]Oh oh oh oh
[02:48.91]Oh oh oh oh
[02:52.65]Where are you going?
[02:54.87]Don't leave me alone
[02:57.05]How do I follow you
[03:02.77]Into the unknown? (Oh oh oh)
